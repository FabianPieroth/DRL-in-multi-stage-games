Welcome to Cont-MARL's documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to the documentation of this multiagent reinforcement learning framework capable of handling continuous state and action spaces.

This is a work in progress, so the documentation is still incomplete, and may even be outdated or specific to our local deployments in some places. We'll be working to bring the documentation up to paar in the near future. If you need additional help in the meantime, please get in touch with one of the maintainers.
